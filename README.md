# Recommender-System-Using-Collaborative-Filtering
  - I have done the book recommender system project using the collaborative filtering and deployed it using flask.
  - I have also done the same using the matrix factorization.
  - After completing the book recommender system using CLF, you will get four pickle files, that are:- final ratings, books, popular books and similarity scores.
  - Similarity scores are used for recommending the books.
  - You will be using these pickle files in the app.py, i.e., Your flask app, and the tempelates that this flask app will be rendering are index.html and recommend.html
